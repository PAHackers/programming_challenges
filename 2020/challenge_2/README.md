# Challenge

Improve the performance of your code from [challenge #1](../challenge_1/README.md)

If you have not participated in round 1, you can earn 5 points for any
submission that posts better times than the last place submission from round 1.
You can earn an additional 5 points if you include a time complexity analysis
of your algorithm using Big-O notation.

## Scoring Points


### Performance Improvements
10 points for cutting your worst run time in half

15 points for improving your worst run time by 1 order of magnitude

5 points for every additional order of magnitude

10 bonus points for getting within 5% of thunderhorse's round 1 times

15 bonus points for getting within 5% of thunderhorse's round 2 times (that's
right, I improved my times, too!)

### Analysis
If you have not submited a time complexity analysis as part of round 1, you
can earn 5 points by submitting it during round 2.

Additional 5 points for a time complexity analysis of your round 2 code.
Include an explaination of how you were able to optimize the performance.

## Submission and Due Date
PM your code to @ThunderHorse on the PA Hackers by 11:59PM on Sunday, October 04, 2020.
